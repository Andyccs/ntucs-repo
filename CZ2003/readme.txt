Assignment 1: Implicit Fantasies
Filename: Assignment1.wrl
The Object is a ukulele. I separate ukulele shape into 8 FShape nodes

The shapes were cylinders (the body of the ukulele and the strings), boxes (the board, saddle and nut), ellipsoids (tuning), cones (tuning_head), and blobby shape (the ribbon). 

The body of the ukulele was created using two cylinders. Cylinder has to be created using intersection operation. The cylinders were union together. Next, part of the top cylinder was removed by using difference operation. 

Fancy color was defined by using parametric function. It was applied to the body and the board of the ukulele. 

3D Texture was applied to the ribbon to change the blobby object so that it looks like a ribbon.
